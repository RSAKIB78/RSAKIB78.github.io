					<h3 class="major">Changes in Customer Perception due to
						Pandemic - Airbnb </h3>
					<ul class="contact">
						<li class="icon brands fa-github"><a
								href="https://github.com/RSAKIB78/Airbnb-Text_Mining-Project-R-SQLite">GitHub Repo</a>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The onset of COVID-19 posed an unforeseen threat to the unprecedented growth of Airbnb,
						being met with major disruptions in form of travel restrictions, government restrictions and
						social-distancing protocols. Both business and personal travel plans had to be put on hold
						globally and the sharing economy faced a drop in revenues. This transpired into plummeting
						occupancy rates on Airbnb from the levels in 2019 (AirDNA, 2020).</p>
					<p>The project aims to identify changes in customer attitudes, described through usage of
						particular words, emotions and topics. All
						these are accomplished through appropriate data preparation from large text and selective
						metadata inclusion. The tools utilized for analysis in this research are R and R Studio,
						leveraging the relevant text mining packages available. SQLite is used as preferred method
						for faster data ingestion and dataset extraction of large datasets.</p>
					<p>Ultimately, aim is to provide such detailed insights into the effect of COVID-19 on customer
						behaviours, which Airbnb can utilise to make necessary modifications to its services to meet
						customer needs based on their perception coming out of the pandemic. The
						significant textual predictors will connect changes in customer attitudes and preferences and
						provide predictive recommendations.</p>
					<img decoding="async" width="1200" height="550" src="images/proj1/proj1.jpg">
					<p>Airbnb has a publicly available repository of data on “Inside Airbnb”
						website, which records monthly snapshots of Airbnb datasets. The data for 16 cities from
						various parts of the world are collected based on the popularity of the cities for tourism. The
						rationale is that the effects of pandemic, as seen in the most popular cities, will impact
						Airbnb
						the most as well and hence, the change in customer attitudes from these cities will be
						representative of the expected impact to be seen in other regions where Airbnb has active
						operations.</p>

					<p>The overall analysis detects various changes in customer attitudes during the
						pandemic and their impacts on ratings. But, there are indications
						that the pre-pandemic attitudes might be returning, based on the predictive algorithms used
						in the analysis. Temporal projections of the sentiments and topic models show that trends
						have tended to return to the pre-pandemic levels at the end of 2021, providing basis for
						deducing that the changes might be temporary. While that is the case, the adaptation of
						behaviours of customers with the pandemic era might persist even if they don’t translate into
						ratings. Such cases could be how customers became much less concerned with external
						facilities around the location of their bookings and the increase in sensitivity towards
						cleanliness and communication. While Airbnb might not require to substantially change the
						nature of their services due to the observed transitory changes in customer attitudes, they
						must persevere to address the attributes that customers have started to increasingly value
						following the pandemic to not damage the trust that customers have in Airbnb by default since
						the pre-pandemic era.</p>
